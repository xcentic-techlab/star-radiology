//     question: "Is MRI scanning safe for all patients?",
//     answer:
//       "Yes, MRI is considered a very safe diagnostic procedure because it uses powerful magnetic fields and radio waves instead of harmful radiation. Most patients can safely undergo MRI scans without any side effects. However, patients who have implanted medical devices such as pacemakers, metal implants, cochlear implants or surgical clips should inform the technician beforehand so that proper safety screening can be performed.",

//   {
//     question: "How long does an MRI scan usually take to complete?",
//     answer:
//       "An MRI scan typically takes between 20 to 45 minutes depending on the body part being examined and the type of imaging required. Some advanced or contrast-enhanced scans may take slightly longer. During the scan, patients are required to remain still to ensure clear and accurate images for diagnosis.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "Do I need to fast or prepare before undergoing an MRI scan?",
//     answer:
//       "In most cases, fasting is not required before an MRI scan. You may eat and drink normally unless your doctor has specifically advised otherwise. If a contrast agent is required for your scan, you may be asked to avoid food for a few hours prior. Our staff will guide you clearly regarding any preparation instructions.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "Is the MRI procedure painful or uncomfortable?",
//     answer:
//       "MRI scanning is completely painless and non-invasive. You will simply lie comfortably on the scanning table while the machine captures detailed images. Some patients may hear loud tapping or humming sounds during the scan, but ear protection is provided for comfort. If you experience claustrophobia or anxiety, our team can assist you to ensure a relaxed experience.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "When and how will I receive my MRI report?",
//     answer:
//       "MRI reports are usually available within a few hours to one working day depending on the complexity of the scan. Reports can be accessed digitally through our secure reporting system or collected in printed format from the center. Our radiologists ensure accurate interpretation and timely delivery of results.",
//   },
//   {
//     question: "Can I undergo MRI if I have metal implants or medical devices?",
//     answer:
//       "Some metal implants and electronic devices may not be compatible with MRI due to the strong magnetic field. It is very important to inform our staff about any implants, prior surgeries or medical devices before the scan. Our safety team will review your details and determine whether the scan can be safely performed or if alternative imaging is required.",
